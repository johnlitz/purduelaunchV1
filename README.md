# Purdue Launch Website V1
Purdue Launch's first website source code created about a year ago. 

First full-on, public website I've ever made and my first introduction to bootstrap.js.

Safe to say I've learned a little bit since then.

Also shoutout to [Nate Hughes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nate-hughes-948664250/) for the AWS/DNS help as I still have no idea how to do any of that!
We probably wouldn't have a website without you!

Archiving it here :D
